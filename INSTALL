The build only works on Intel Mac so far.

INTEL MAC SETUP NOTES
---------------------

In order to use the Gecko SDK that we're using, you're going to need libidl from MacPorts. To do this, grab MacPorts from:

 	http://www.macports.org/install.php

Then, install libidl

	`sudo /opt/local/bin/port install libidl`

This will grab a whole boatload of stuff and keep your machine warm for a few minutes.

BUILDING DESKTOP UPLOADER
-------------------------

In this directory, run:

	`rake build`

If needed, this will take care of pulling in the XUL Runner Framework, the Gecko SDK, et al.

BUILDING FOR DEVELOPMENT
------------------------

In this directory, run:

	`rake hotbuild`

That will build an application bundle and link its Resources to `application` in this directory.

PACKAGING DESKTOP UPLOADER
--------------------------

In this directory, run:

	`rake package`

You'll be prompted to provide your password for sudo, since building the full .dmg requires root.

CLEANING UP
-----------

To clean things up, run:

	`rake clobber`

BUILDING XULRUNNER AND SDK FROM SOURCE
--------------------------------------

Quick notes. The following steps will work, but you have to do them in this order

$ sudo /opt/local/bin/port install libidl
$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin

$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot co mozilla/client.mk
$ make -f client.mk checkout MOZ_CO_PROJECT=xulrunner

Create ~/.mozconfig that contains the following lines (the last lines here will mess up a check out if you've got them and haven't checked out the project already from above):

-----
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-@CONFIG_GUESS@
mk_add_options MOZ_CO_PROJECT=xulrunner
ac_add_options --enable-macos-target=10.4
ac_add_options --with-macos-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/
ac_add_options --enable-application=xulrunner
#ac_add_options --enable-libxul
ac_add_options --disable-shared
ac_add_options --enable-static
ac_add_options --disable-tests
ac_add_app_options ppc --enable-prebinding
. $topsrcdir/xulrunner/config/mozconfig
# . $topsrcdir/build/macosx/universal/mozconfig
-----

then

$ make -f client.mk build

after that, you'll have a full-on XULRunner and SDK built. If you uncomment the last line of the .mozconfig, the build will attempt to do a universal build. But it currently fails.
